# Coin-Toss-Probability-Simulator
 This Python project simulates multiple coin tosses to calculate the probability of getting heads or tails. Using the random module, it counts each outcome and computes their frequencies and probabilities, providing a simple yet effective demonstration of probability and randomness concepts in Python.
